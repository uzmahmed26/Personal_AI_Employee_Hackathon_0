# CEO Briefing Skill

Generates the "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" — an autonomous weekly business audit that reads completed tasks, Odoo financial data, and system metrics to produce an executive-level briefing in Obsidian.

## Objective

Produce a comprehensive `Briefings/YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md` file that gives the CEO / business owner a complete picture of: revenue, bottlenecks, AI system performance, and proactive suggestions.

## Procedure

### 1. Gather Data from All Sources

**Task Performance:**
```bash
python weekly_ceo_report.py
ls 03_Completed_Tasks/
ls 05_Failed_Tasks/
```

**Financial Data (via Odoo MCP):**
```
Use MCP tool: odoo → get_financial_summary
  period: this_week

Use MCP tool: odoo → get_overdue_invoices
```

**Email Activity:**
```
Use MCP tool: gmail → search_emails
  query: "is:sent after:[7 days ago]"
  max_results: 20
```

**LinkedIn Performance:**
```
Use MCP tool: linkedin → get_recent_posts
  count: 5
```

**System metrics:**
```bash
cat Dashboard.md
ls Decision_Ledger/
```

### 2. Analyse the Data

Calculate these metrics:
- **Revenue this week**: Sum of paid Odoo invoices
- **Outstanding receivables**: Sum of unpaid invoices
- **Overdue invoices**: List with amounts and age
- **Tasks completed**: Count from 03_Completed_Tasks/
- **Tasks failed**: Count from 05_Failed_Tasks/
- **System success rate**: completed / (completed + failed) * 100
- **LinkedIn engagement**: Posts published this week
- **Response time**: Average email reply time if available

Identify **bottlenecks**:
- Tasks that exceeded expected completion time (retry_count > 3)
- Overdue invoices older than 30 days
- Failed tasks that need manual intervention

Generate **proactive suggestions**:
- Subscriptions unused > 30 days (from expense transactions)
- Patterns in failed tasks (same task type failing repeatedly)
- Upcoming deadlines in next 7 days
- Revenue trends (up/down vs previous week)

### 3. Generate the Briefing File

Create `Briefings/YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md` with this exact structure:

```markdown
---
generated: <ISO timestamp>
period: <start date> to <end date>
type: monday_briefing
---

### 4. Save and Log

```python
# Save to Briefings/ folder
import os
os.makedirs("Briefings", exist_ok=True)
# Write the briefing file
```

```bash
# Create a task record
python run_task_skill.py create -t manual \
  -d "Monday Morning CEO Briefing generated" \
  -p high \
  -m briefing_file="Briefings/<date>_Monday_Briefing.md"

# Update Dashboard
python dashboard_updater.py
```

### 5. Alert if Critical Issues Found

If any of these conditions exist, create a high-priority alert:
- Overdue invoices > $500 total
- Failed tasks > 5
- System success rate < 85%
- Any task in 05_Failed_Tasks/ older than 3 days

```bash
python run_task_skill.py create -t approval_required \
  -d "ALERT: Critical issues found in weekly audit — review required" \
  -p critical --approval
```

## Briefing Schedule

The briefing runs automatically every Sunday at midnight via `autonomous_system.py`.
To trigger manually:

```bash
python weekly_ceo_report.py
```

Or via this skill when the user asks for "CEO briefing" or "weekly report".

## Output Location

All briefings are saved to:
```
Briefings/
├── YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md
├── YYYY-MM-DD_Monday_Briefing.md
└── ...
```

The latest briefing is also referenced in `Dashboard.md`.
